Why?
====

So I live in a timezone where the NHL games are often over at 5am in the morning. I tend to watch replays. I'm not always sure if there was a game last night. Schedules often have the results too. I tend to not want to know the results if I intend to watch the replay. It would be really nice if I could just browse to $URL/team and it would tell me if my team played last night or during stanley cup $URL would be enough.

Forked from https://github.com/amanjeev/isitfridaythe13th because it had the google appspot already in it and python :) Thanks!

I am obsessed with Friday the 13th examples. This is just a trial app to test basics of Google App Engine.
