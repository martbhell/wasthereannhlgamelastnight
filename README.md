==========================

Why?
====

So I live in a timezone where the NHL games are often over at 5am in the morning. I tend to watch replays. I'm not always sure if there was a game last night. Schedules often have the results too. I tend to not want to know the results if I intend to watch the replay. It would be really nice if I could just browse to $URL/team and it would tell me if my team played last night or during stanley cup $URL would be enough.

How?
====

Getting the playoff list is manual (for now):

 1 Visit http://www.nhl.com/ice/schedulebyseason.htm
 2 Click on print
 3 Print as pdf
 4 pdftotext
 5 Alter the python script to point to the new file and print what you want (only the dates).


How to make this work per team and regular season?

Forked from https://github.com/amanjeev/isitfridaythe13th because it had the google appspot already in it and python :) Thanks!

I am obsessed with Friday the 13th examples. This is just a trial app to test basics of Google App Engine.
